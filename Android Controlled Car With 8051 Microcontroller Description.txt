This project showcases an Android phone-controlled car built using an 8051 microcontroller and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The car uses DC motors -controlled by a driver- for movement, controlled via commands from an Android app, with real-time status feedback. The microcontroller is programmed in assembly language for efficient low-level hardware control, and the project includes detailed instructions for interfacing the HC-05 with the 8051.
