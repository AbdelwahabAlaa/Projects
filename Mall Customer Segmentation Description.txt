This Kaggle project focuses on segmenting mall customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing patterns and behaviors. The primary goal is to enable targeted advertising campaigns and enhance customer reviews by understanding customer segments more effectively.

Key elements include:

Data Preprocessing: Utilizes NumPy and Pandas for efficient data handling, along with LabelEncoder and StandardScaler from scikit-learn to prepare the dataset for clustering.

Clustering Techniques: Implements multiple clustering algorithms including KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering to explore different grouping strategies. Advanced methods such as kmeans_plusplus are used to optimize initial cluster centers.

Evaluation & Visualization: Uses silhouette_score to assess cluster quality, and leverages Matplotlib, Seaborn, and dendrograms (via SciPy) to visualize cluster structures and relationships.

Business Application: The identified clusters offer actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies and improved customer service, ultimately driving enhanced customer satisfaction.
